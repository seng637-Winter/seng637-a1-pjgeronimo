# Introduction

This lab serves as an introduction to exploratory, manual scripted, and regression testing. The system under test (SUT) is a simulation of an ATM, with basic functions such as cash withdrawal, deposits, and transfers between accounts. This lab also serves as an introduction to Atlassian Jira, a widely used bug tracking system. 

Prior to completion of this lab, our knowledge of exploratory and manual functional testing is composed of what has been discussed in chapter 2 of this course. Exploratory testing consists of the tester exploring the application and trying to create realistic scenarios in which a user might find themselves. Manual scripted testing involves following a pre-written path, or a test suite composed of test cases.

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

## Test Types

The type of testing to be done is system testing, since the given ATM system is a complete system.

## Scope of Testing

The scope of testing will be composed of the requirements that are included in Appendix B.

The functions to be tested include:

- Customer inserting their card and entering their PIN
- Cash withdrawal from any account on the card in increments of $20.00
- Desposit to any suitable account on the card
  - Cash deposit
  - Cheque desposit
- Money transfer between two accounts
- Balance inquiry of any account on the card
- Cancel key aborts any in progress transactions
- Three invalid PIN attempts will cause the ATM to retain the card until the customer contacts the bank
- The ATM will display any explanations of failed transactions
- The ATM prints receipts for each successful transaction, including:
  - Date, time
  - Machine location
  - Type of transaction
- Ending and available balances for the affected account(s)
- Switch allows operator to start or stop service
- Operator is able to enter the total amount of cash in the ATM
- Internal log of transactions

### Other things to consider

When testing functions that involve the user typing a specified amount (such as tranfers and desposits), a range of amounts should be considered. For example, trying to transfer/deposit $0.00, an amount greater than what is in the current account, and the maximum possible amount.

Another thing to consider is testing invalid key pad inputs, such as pressing 5 when there are only 4 options to choose from on screen.

## Test Approach/Logistics

Each pair in the group will complete exploratory testing on their own. One person in the pair will test the functions, while the other reports any bugs/defects on the Jira board, filling out the necessary information. Since there are two cards, the functions will be tested once on each card, and the pair will switch roles when moving on to the second card.

# Comparison of exploratory and manual functional testing

## Benefits 

Exploratory Testing: 

- Adaptability: can adapt to various approaches from different testers 
- Engagement and Creativity: Allows testers to think outside the box and find unexpected scenarios that may occur.
  - Allows testers to get insight and detect issues in the application that may otherwise be missed in manual function testing (e.g., ATM freezing bug detected on a Mac OS was found) 

Manual Function Testing: 

- Reproducibility: test cases can easily be repeated across difference versions while maintaining consistency 

- Requires less initial knowledge about the application since testers follow predefined test cases 

 

## Tradeoffs 

Exploratory testing did not have well-documented, measurable test coverage, making it difficult to reproduce the testing process. It is also harder to confirm if all the requirements have been met and critical defects can be missed without the documentation. Manual function testing, however, is more time consuming and less flexible since it requires the tester to follow strict test cases that were designed in advance. Unfortunately, the lack of flexibility can cause testers to overlook unexpected scenarios by strictly following the script. The work of manual function testing can also be repetitive.  

 

## Effectiveness

Exploratory testing identified most defects in the application, while manual function testing captured some defects missed during the exploratory testing phase. There were five defects identified by both testing methods. Out of the 17 defects found in total, 13 defects were identified by the exploratory testing method, therefore this method proved to be more effective in comparison. It is important to note that the combination of both approaches utilized the strengths of each to achieve a comprehensive testing process, whereas if each method was done in isolation, bugs may have been missed. 

 

## Efficiency

Exploratory testing was more efficient in identifying many defects quickly as it utilizes the tester’s knowledge and intuition without the extensive planning needed in manual functional testing.  

# Notes and discussion of the peer reviews of defect reports

Our peer review testing was performed in two separate stages: 

1. Group 2’s review on defects report made by Group 1 (Exploratory testing) 

2. Group 1’s review on defects report made by Group 2 (Manual scripted testing) 

Reviewing Group 2’s defect report was straightforward in terms of understanding the bugs encountered, the outcomes and the reproduction steps. Specifically, the detailed reproduction steps allow us to reproduce the bugs quickly and without ambiguity. However, during their manual scripted testing, Group 2 identified MFT (6) as a bug because the ATM failed to reject the card immediately, a behavior Group 1 identified but considered as normal behavior. After discussing our observations, we collectively determined that MTF (6) did not constitute a bug. However, we note the importance of providing detailed and precise information on defect reports and test suits to prevent misunderstanding.  

# How the pair testing was managed and team work/effort was divided

The team was split into a group of 2 and a group of 3 for pair testing. Since there are 2 cards in the SUT, the group of 2 had one person perform the exploratory and scripted testing on one card, while the other person observed and recorded any bugs. Once all the testing was complete on the first card, the pair would switch roles and perform the tests on the other card. The group of 3 decided to divide the work by task, assigning each person the same number of tasks for both manual and scripted testing. Each group then came together for regression testing, where the retests were distributed among everyone. 

# Difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned

An interesting challenge we encountered occurred when the same test was performed on different operating systems. On Windows, we observed that pressing an invalid key on the keypad causes the SUT to dispense $20. On macOS, the same action would cause the SUT to be unresponsive for a short amount of time. Whether the system dispenses $20 or not is ambiguous on macOS, because it would not show the money being dispensed on the screen, but the log states that the system did dispense the money. To best describe the defects on our bug tracking board, we created 2 separate records since two different outcomes were produced. 

Throughout this lab, we learned the importance of both exploratory and scripted testing, and the role each one plays in finding a SUT’s defects. We also learned the importance of maintaining an effective bug tracking board. Having bug reports that concisely describe the steps to reproduce the bug allows for regression testing to be much less time consuming. Having a clearly described expected and actual outcomes on the initial bug report also allows the regression tester to more easily determine if the bug has been fixed or not.  

We found that this lab served as a good introduction to testing and bug tracking. The ATM system was simple in terms of functionality, which allowed us to focus more on testing and tracking, as opposed to the system itself. While the assignment description was verbose, it was easy to follow, as the steps were clearly distinguished from each other and organized in a logical manner.
