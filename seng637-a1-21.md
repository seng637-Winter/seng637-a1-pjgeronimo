# Introduction

An introduction of your lab work, and what you knew about exploratory and manual
functional testing before this lab

# High-level description of the exploratory testing plan

## Test Types

The type of testing to be done is system testing, since the given ATM system is a complete system.

## Scope of Testing

The scope of testing will be composed of the requirements that are included in Appendix B.

The functions to be tested include:

- Customer inserting their card and entering their PIN
- Cash withdrawal from any account on the card in increments of $20.00
- Desposit to any suitable account on the card
  - Cash deposit
  - Cheque desposit
- Money transfer between two accounts
- Balance inquiry of any account on the card
- Cancel key aborts any in progress transactions
- Three invalid PIN attempts will cause the ATM to retain the card until the customer contacts the bank
- The ATM will display any explanations of failed transactions
- The ATM prints receipts for each successful transaction, including:
  - Date, time
  - Machine location
  - Type of transaction
- Ending and available balances for the affected account(s)
- Switch allows operator to start or stop service
- Operator is able to enter the total amount of cash in the ATM
- Internal log of transactions

## Test Approach/Logistics

Each pair in the group will complete exploratory testing on their own. One person in the pair will test the functions, while the other reports any bugs/defects on the Jira board, filling out the necessary information.
